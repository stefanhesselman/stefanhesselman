ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stefan Hesselman.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Bug bounty hunting, vulnerability research, hiking, running, cooking, and studying human pathological behaviors and origins.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Red Team Operations.

âœ¨ As I discover them, I'll post exploits and proof-of-concepts here.
